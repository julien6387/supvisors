# **Supvisors**
[![PyPI version][pypi-image]][pypi-url] [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Documentation Status][docs-image]][docs-url]


**Supvisors** is a Control System for Distributed Applications, based on
multiple instances of Supervisor.

The main features are:
   * a new web-based dashboard that replaces the default dashboard of Supervisor,
   * an extended XML-RPC API to control applications and multiple Supervisor instances,
   * the definition of a rules file to handle:
      * the starting sequence of the applications,
      * the stopping sequence of the applications,
      * the starting strategy of the processes,
      * the strategy to apply when a process crashes.
