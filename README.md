**Supvisors** is a Control System for Distributed Applications, based on multiple instances of Supervisor
running over multiple nodes.

The main features are:
* a new web-based dashboard that replaces the default dashboard of Supervisor and allows to control
  all the Supervisor instances declared,
* an extended XML-RPC API to control applications and processes over the multiple Supervisor instances,
* a notification interface to get the events from multiple Supervisor instances on a `PyZmq` socket. 

A set of application and program rules can be added to manage:
* the starting sequence of the applications,
* the stopping sequence of the applications,
* the starting strategy of the processes,
* the strategy to apply when a process crashes or when a node shut down,
* the strategy to apply when conflicts are detected.

The Supervisor program `supervisorctl` has been extended to include the additional XML-RPC API.

Also provided in the scope of this project:
* a `JAVA` client with a full implementation of the Supervisor and **Supvisors** XML-RPC API ;
* a `Flask-RESTX` application that exposes the Supervisor and **Supvisors** XML-RPC API through a REST API.
