    The strategies are linked to the RunningFailureStrategies enumeration.

    Any Supvisors instance may hold application processes with different running failure strategies.
    If the Supvisors instance becomes inactive, as seen from another Supvisors instance, it could lead
    to have all possible strategies to apply on the same application and related processes, which makes no sense.

    So it has been chosen to give a priority to the strategies.
    The highest priority is for the most restricting strategy, consisting in stopping the application.
    Then, the priority goes to the strategy having the highest impact, i.e. restarting the application.
    The lowest priority is for the most simple strategy consisting in restarting only the involved process.

        - stop_application_jobs: the set of application names to be stopped,
        - restart_application_jobs: the set of application names to be restarted,
        - restart_process_jobs: the set of processes to be restarted.

        - start_application_jobs: the set of application to be started (deferred job).
